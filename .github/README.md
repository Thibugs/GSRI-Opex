# GSRI OPEX

## What is GSRI OPEX

This mod is a toolset based on the original OpexTemplate project. It allows GSRI members to speed up the mission design process by providing a basic spawn template relying on the Liberty class destroyer. It is quite heavily dependant of the GSRI modpack, but most of the functions provided here can be used with only [CBA](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3) and [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3) running. Some small modifications are enough to make this template fully usable with any other modpack.

Using this template when starting a new mission allows the editor to focus on what really matters : designing an immersive, gameplay oriented piece of work. It also contains most of the usual structures of a proper mission : function library, localisation file, several images, etc.
